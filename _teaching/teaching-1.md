New sources of data (big data, small data and everything in between) raise the exciting
possibility that such data could benefit the worldâ€™s poor. This course is designed to provide
students with an intermediate-level review of recent research that deploys new data for
insights on development and hands-on analysis of different kinds of datasets. Students will
investigate 3 key themes in development: corruption and accountability, migration, and
Authoritarian Backsliding.  

As we explore these topics, students will develop data analytical skills that are useful across
a wide range of research and real-world applications. Students will learn how to implement
four of the most common research designs in the social sciences: observational studies,
randomized experiments (in particular, survey experiments), regression discontinuity designs,
and difference-in-difference designs. Students will have the opportunity to work with a wide
variety of data types, from survey and government-produced administrative data to text
as data. As such, students will come face-to-face with the opportunities and challenges for
data-intensive approaches to international development.
