title: "The Human Impact of Deportation: Resettlement and Remigration."
category: forced
collection: research
order: 14
citation: "What determines the resettlement and remigration preferences and decisions of deportees? We argue that returnees seek locations in their country of origin which can provide them with physical safety, employment, and social and familial ties. When returnees are unable to achieve these goals within their country of origin, they look to remigrate. Experimental and observational evidence from an original survey of over 1,300 deportees from the United States to Guatemala suggests that deportees are focused on security, jobs, and social networks when deciding where to go within Guatemala. But, in follow up surveys, fewer than half are employed, and many are living in considerably insecure locations. Indeed, unstable economic and security conditions in Guatemala compared to the United States are key determinants of remigration preferences. These findings provide concrete evidence that deportation does not successfully halt migration in the absence of improvement in conditions in home countries."
